#summary SauAST details.

= Introduction =

Recently a new kernel branch called sauast has been added. SauAST is a rewrite of our current code, still in C and Multiboot ASM.


= Details =

SauAST was commited when the code we had would not simply link. asteinborn78, the orignal developer of SauOS, destined to rewrite SauOS for two reasons:

 * The current code was based off a tutorial kernel.
 * Of course the code wouldn't compile.

In the rewrite, bkerndev was used as a _reference_, not the _code_.
